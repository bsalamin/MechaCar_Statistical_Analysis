# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
Statistics in R and RStudio

The following statistical analysis utilizes R and RStudio to accomplish the following:
* Load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.
* Visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots using ggplot2.
* Generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.
* Plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.
* Formulate null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.
* Implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.
* Implement and evaluate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given dataset.
* Implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.
* Identify key characteristics of A/B and A/A testing.
* Determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.
